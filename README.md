# my-first-repo
Hi, I'm Xinyuan. A college sophomore staring to learn CS. This is the first repository that I've ever created. I'll post small projects I made for my classes and interests.

Currently, this repo consists of 3 folders
1. A fullstack class project I did for my CS class. It's an online chat room developed with Javascript
2. A simple survey form I made to learn HTML/CSS
3. Practice with data analysis
